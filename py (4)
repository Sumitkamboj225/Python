1--what is python?

python is a both object oriented & fucntion oriented high level programming language with class, object, function, exception and automatically mermory management.
it is one of the fastest programming language as it requires less lines of code
python is very easy programming language which make it a great choice for begginners.

2--what is PEP 8?
 PEP 8 is python's style guide.Its a set of rules for how to format your python code to maximize its readability.

3--what is pickling & unpickling?

the process of seperating data from an object is called pickling
to perform pickling we have to use dump() from pickle module

the process of reconstruct an object on the basis of data is called as unpickling.
to perform unpickling we have to use load() from pickle module

to perfrom  both pickling and pickling python has provided a predifined library is the from of pickle module 


4--what is python decorators?
decorator is a function it will take a function as parameter and it will extand its functionality and it will return the modified functions
the main intention of decorators is to extand the existed method functionality without changing its code.


5-- what is generators in python?
generator is a function which is responsible to generate a sequence of values, by using yield keyword.

6--what is lambda in python?
name less function is called anonymous function.
anonymous functins is also called lambdas.
in general we will use lambda when we want to pass one function as parameter to another functions.

7--why lambda forms in python doesnot have statement?



8--what is name space in python?

9--in python what are iterator?


10--what is unit test in python?


11-- what is slicing?
the slice() return a slice object that can used to slice string,tuple,list etc..`

12--what is docstring in python??
a python documentation string is known as docstring,it is a way of documenting python fuctions,modules, classes


13--how can you copy an object in python?
to copy an object in python use can try copy.copy() or copy.deepcopy() for the genral case. you can not copy all the object but most of them


14--diff between range and xrange?
range() & xrange() are two function that could be used to iterate a certain no of times in for loops in python. In python3 there is no xrange,but range() behave like xrange in python2


15--what is module & package in python??
module is the way to structure programe.
each python program is  a module.
the folder of python program is a packege of modules,a package can have modules or sub folder.


16--mention rule of local var & global var?
 local:- if a variable is assigned anywhere with in the function body, its assumed to be local,it can be accessed only with in the block in which it has defined

global:- those variable that are decleared outside of the function its assumed to be global we can access its variable at anywhere


--explain how can you make a python script executable on unix?
to make a python script executable on the unix, you need to do two things
1) scripts file mode must be executable
2)the first line must begain with #


--explain how to delete a file in python?
by using command os.remove(filename) or os.unlink(filename)


--explain how can you genrate random no in python?
to genrate random no in pytho n you need to-
import random
random.random()
this returm a rendom floting point no in the range[0,1]


--explain how can you access a module written in python from c?
 you can access a module written in python from c by following method 
module==PyImport_ImportModule("<module name>");


--five benifit of python?
1-python does not require explicit memory management.
itself it is allocate the momery to new variable and free them automaticallyfor row in range(0,10):
2-provide easy readibility due to use of squre bracket.
3-easy to learn for beginners.
4-having the buit-in datatype saves programming time and effort from declearing variable
5- python having huge standard library for must internet plateforms like email,html

--use of split()
if we want to split a string into no of substring in the from of a list then we have to use .split()

--what is flast,pyramid,django?
flask is a web microfreamework for python, by using flask you build for a small application.
pyramid are build for larger application.
django are also build for larger application

--explain what is Dogpile effect? how can you prevent this effect?
Dogpile effect is reffred to the event when cache expire, and website are hit by the multiple request made by the client at the same time
this effect can be prevent by using semaphore lock.in this system when value expires first process acquires the lock & starts generating new value

--what is data Abstraction?
Data abstraction refers to providing only neccessery information about data to the outside world,hiding the background details or implimentation.


--what is encapsulation?
Encapsulation is the wrapping,just hiding properties & method.Encapsultion is used for hide the code & data in a single unit to protech the data from the outside the world. Class is the best example of encapsulation.

--what is enum??
enum is a class in python for creating enumeration, which are a set of symbolic names bound to unique,constent values.
by using type() we can check the enum type.


--diff betweem script & program
a program(process) is a set of instruction
a script is a sub program or sub process

--what is compiler?
it a translator which is used to convert the source code(high level code)into machine code all at once if all instrucations are correct

--diff between compiler & interprator?
compiler is a  translator which is used to convert the source code(high level code)into machine code all at once if all instrucations are correct.
interprator also a translator it translate the code line by line & genrate the output for tanslated instructions


--why python is interprator programming language
python code need not be compiled.
python inteprator is able to run the source code directly & genrate output


--use of pass keyword
"pass" keyword is used to define empty blocks,function, classes

--use of "break" keyword
"break" is used to terminate the flow of a loop

--use of chr() 
it is used to convert corressponding interger value to specified symbol


-what is class?
the complete representation of real world entity is called class
it a blue print or model of object


--what is object?
a real world entity with an identity,properties & functionality
identity is unique & it is used to access the object

--describe self reference variable.
it hold object address. 
To refer current class variables and current class methods by using 'self' variable.

--what is the need of encapsulation?
protecting the object member(data & code)

--what is inheritance?
it is a relation between calsses,it will provide variable & function from one class[parent class] to another class[child class] inoder to improve code resuability.

--Advantage of Inheritance?
-code reusability(Declare variables and methods one time in super class then access that variables and methods in any no of times in sub classes.)
- minimize the amount of duplicate code
-inheritance can also make application code more flexible



--is python are object oriented programming language?
yesss python is fully object oriented programming language.Every data is repersented in the form of object .it doesn't supprot primtive types



--what is function?
 in genral we need to execute a set of instructions repeatedly ,if we provide the same set of instructions again & again as the requirement then code will be increased, it is not suggestable in any application.
function is a set of instrucations to repersent a particular action.

--advantage of fuction??
-code reuseability 
-easy implementation of application

--what is the use of a global keyword?
-this keyword is used to create global variable from a non-global scope.i.e inside a function

--what is method overraiding?
defining a method in the child class with the same name & same signature of parent class method
overriding can be implimented only in parent child relation

--need of method overrading?
the main advantage of method overrading is to update parent object functionality in the child class if it is not sufficent to child class


--what is the object reference variable?
a user variable that holds the address of object is called object reference variable.

--diff match() & search() in RE.
match() is used to check whether the strings starts with specified pattern or not
search() is used to find whether the strings contains specified pattern or not


--define polymorphism?
defining an object(class) that shows different behavior(functionlity) with the same identity,it is called polymorphism.

-- what is runtime polymorphism?
it is also called dynamin binding.it method overriding technique.


--how can we achive method overloading?
it is not possible to impliment method overloading in python programming language.Overloading is called compile time binding.But python is a interprator programming language.

--what is constructor?
it is a specified method call automatically in object creation process.


--can i access 'self' any where in the program.
'self' is an argument of function or constructor.
'argument' are working like local variable & local variable can be accessed only with in the function.


--what is execption?
it is a run time error.
execption provides informal information to end-user


--how to handel execption in python?
by using try-except blocks

--what is try?
-it is a keyword
-it is a block of instructioin
-doubtful code that raises execptions must be placed inside the try block in execption handling


--what is except block?
-except block contain exception handeling logic
-exception execute only if an exception has risen in try block


--why handling exception?
the exception causes abnoraml termination of program execution
the exception provides informal information to end-user


--Advantage of except block?
it avoid abnormal termination of the program in cause of exception.
it is used to provide formal information to end-user

--what is exception object?


--what is multitasking?
performing more than one task simulteneously in the application


--Advantage of multitasking?
the best utilization of the CPU resource & complete the task prallel processing


--what is the diff between multi-tasking & multithreading?
-in multitasking , n tasks execute in n process spaces where as in multithreading , n tasks execute in single process space.


--how to create a thread??
By extending the functonality of the pre-defined thread class. Thread class belongs to a module called "thrading"


--what is the use of run() method?
it is the pre-defined method available in thread class.
it is used to place the thread logic that will execute parallel & independent from thared space

--can we call a run() method directly?
yes,but the login excute from the current thread space.


--why do we need to call the start() method to start a thread?
start() method provides pre-defined logic to allocate the thread space from which run() method logic execute independently

--what is the use of sleep() method?
sleep() method is used to stops theread execution for the specified no of millisec


--diff between sleep() & join()
sleep() method stops the thread execution for the specified no of sec
join() method stops the thread untill joined thread execution complete


--what is synchorization?
allowing threads sequentially when multiple threads are trying to access a resources
